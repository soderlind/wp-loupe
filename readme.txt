A powerful search enhancement plugin for WordPress that delivers fast, accurate, and typo-tolerant search results.

== Description ==

WP Loupe transforms WordPress's search functionality by creating a dedicated search index for lightning-fast results, supporting typo-tolerant searches, offering phrase matching and advanced search operators, automatically maintaining the search index, and providing customization options for developers.

= MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration (Preview) =
An optional MCP server (currently in draft on the development branch) allows external agents / AI tools to:
* Discover commands (`/.well-known/mcp.json`)
* Perform anonymous or token-authenticated search (`searchPosts`)
* Retrieve post data & schema (`getPost`, `getSchema`)
* Run health diagnostics (token + `health.read` scope)

Administration (when enabled via Settings → WP Loupe → MCP tab):
* Enable/disable MCP endpoints (hard 404 when disabled)
* Manage access tokens (scopes, TTL hours 1–168 or 0 = indefinite, revoke single/all)
* View last-used timestamps for audit hygiene
* Configure rate limits: separate anonymous vs authenticated window, quota, and max hits per search

Hybrid Access Model:
* Anonymous search: lower limits (configurable) no token required
* Authenticated search: requires `search.read` scope; higher limits
* `healthCheck` always requires token with `health.read`

Security & Extensibility:
* Tokens hashed in storage (raw value shown once)
* HMAC-protected pagination cursors
* Filter hooks allow overriding limits & behavior even after UI config
* WP-CLI command issues tokens (appearing in admin token list)

Full technical documentation: See the GitHub repo `docs/mcp.md` file.

= Filters =

These filters allow developers to customize WP Loupe's behavior:

`wp_loupe_db_path`

Controls where the search index is stored.
Default: WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/wp-loupe-db'

`wp_loupe_post_types`

Modifies which post types are included in search.
Default: ['post', 'page']

`wp_loupe_posts_per_page`

Controls search results per page.
Default: WordPress "Blog pages show at most" setting

`wp_loupe_index_protected`

Controls indexing of password-protected posts.
Default: false

`wp_loupe_field_{$field_name}`

Modifies a field before indexing.
Example: The plugin uses `wp_loupe_field_post_content` to strip HTML tags from content

`wp_loupe_schema_{$post_type}`

Customizes the schema for a post type.

For usage examples, see the [filter documentation at GitHub](https://github.com/soderlind/wp-loupe?tab=readme-ov-file#filters).


== Installation ==

1. **Quick Install**
   * Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-loupe` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly
   * Activate through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

2. **Post-Installation**
   * Visit Settings > WP Loupe to configure
   * Click 'Reindex' to build the initial search index

3. **Updates**
   * Plugin updates are handled automatically via GitHub. No need to manually download and install updates.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it handle updates to posts? =

The search index automatically updates when content is created, modified, or deleted.

= Will it slow down my site? =

No. WP Loupe uses a separate, optimized search index and doesn't impact your main database performance.

= Can I customize what content is searchable? =

Yes, using filters you can control exactly what content gets indexed and how it's searched.

= Does it work with custom post types? =

Yes, you can select which post types to include in the Settings page or via filters.

= How do I use advanced search operators? =

* `Hello World` will search for posts containing `Hello` **or** `World`.
* `"Hello World"` will search for posts containing the exact phrase `Hello World`.
* `Hello -World` will search for posts containing `Hello` but not `World`.

= What are the technical requirements? =

* PHP 8.3 or higher
* SQLite 3.16.0+ (required by the Loupe library)
* WordPress 6.3+


== Changelog ==

= 0.5.3 =
* Added: Copy buttons (with accessible live feedback) for MCP manifest and protected resource endpoints.
* Added: Aria-live region and translatable status messages for copy success/failure.
* Changed: Removed inline JavaScript for endpoint copying; logic centralized in `admin.js`.
* Fixed: Clipboard fallback for browsers without `navigator.clipboard` support.
* Changed: Minor wording clarity improvements in endpoint descriptions.
* Note: Small UX iteration paving the way for richer manifest metadata.

= 0.5.2 =
* Added: Settings surfacing discovery endpoints (manifest & protected resource) for MCP clients.
* Added: Accessibility improvements groundwork (live region placeholder) before 0.5.3 enhancements.
* Changed: Removed POST `/commands` from visible endpoint list (method clarity).
* Fixed: Ensured reliable JSON output for `/.well-known/mcp.json` (rewrite + fallback path).
* Fixed: Clipboard copy resilience improvements (initial implementation) preparing for 0.5.3.
* I18n: Regenerated `wp-loupe.pot` with new MCP strings and translator comments.
* Note: Internal rate-limit option polish and manifest stability adjustments.

= 0.5.1 =
* UI: Wrapped MCP token table in panel and standardized max-width (840px)
* UI: Reordered headings and moved Save button for consistency
* MCP: Token management interface (scopes, TTL presets, revoke all, last-used tracking, copy-once)
* MCP: Hybrid anonymous/authenticated search access with scoped tokens
* MCP: Secure HMAC-signed pagination cursors for `searchPosts`

= 0.5.0 =
* Initial MCP integration (preview): discovery manifest, commands, rate limiting, scoped tokens, pagination security
* Requires PHP 8.3+ and Loupe 0.12.13

= 0.5.0 =
Introduces optional MCP (Model Context Protocol) server (disabled by default). After upgrading:
1. Go to Settings → WP Loupe → MCP tab and enable the server.
2. Create a scoped access token (copy it once) for higher search limits or health checks.
3. (Optional) Adjust rate limits (anonymous vs authenticated) before exposing to external agents.
This is a developer/automation feature; sites not using MCP can ignore these new settings.
